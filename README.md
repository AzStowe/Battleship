## Battleship
* Pseudocode: https://trello.com/b/FSUUfRsp/battleship

## Motivation
I was initially motivated to create this game because off the idea of making a functioning AI. The idea of AI really interest me and I thought that if I could get into the very basics of them then I would be able to understand a bit more of how they work and the coding behind them. 

## General info
How the game works:
There are 2 ships that will be generating on the board. Each ship is 3 gris points long. You will be able to click on a grid location to attempt to find the ship. Once you sink both ships the game is over.
